      "At the Center for Creative Intelligence Design (CCID), we explore the intersection of interaction design, generative AI, and prototyping to shape the future of human-computer interaction. Our interdisciplinary team of designers, researchers, and developers is grounded in deep design research, using methods from behavioral science, psychology, and critical sociology to understand the present in all its complexity. By examining how emerging technologies mediate perception, cognition, and behavior, we translate insights into actionable, innovative solutions.",
      "We leverage AI-powered creativity and computational design to create intuitive, adaptive, and speculative user experiences that respond to the evolving needs of users, businesses, and environments. Our iterative design processes allow us to prototype the future, grounded in real, data-driven insights about the current landscape.",
