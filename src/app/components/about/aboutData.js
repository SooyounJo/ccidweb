      "At the Center for Creative Intelligence Design (CCID), we explore the intersection of interaction design, generative AI, and prototyping to shape the future of human-computer interaction. Our interdisciplinary team of designers, researchers, and developers is grounded in deep design research, using methods from behavioral science, psychology, and critical sociology to understand the present in all its complexity. By examining how emerging technologies mediate perception, cognition, and behavior, we translate insights into actionable, innovative solutions.",
      "We leverage AI-powered creativity and computational design to create intuitive, adaptive, and speculative user experiences that respond to the evolving needs of users, businesses, and environments. Our iterative design processes allow us to prototype the future, grounded in real, data-driven insights about the current landscape. Through our work, we help businesses navigate and lead change by crafting meaningful interactions that redefine how people engage with digital systems, products, services, and spaces.",

    title: "Our Methodology",
    paragraphs: [
      "Our design methodology integrates human-centered principles with interdisciplinary research and computational design. Drawing from fields such as behavioral science, sociology, technology, and the arts, we approach each project as a system of relationships—between people, tools, environments, and data. Rather than applying fixed formulas, we tailor our process to context: conducting qualitative research, prototyping with AI, and iterating through both analytical and intuitive modes of thinking. This allows us to design not just for usability, but for long-term adaptability, inclusivity, and impact. The diagram above reflects how our practice sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines—visualizing the layered perspectives that shape our work and inform how we design for complexity.",
